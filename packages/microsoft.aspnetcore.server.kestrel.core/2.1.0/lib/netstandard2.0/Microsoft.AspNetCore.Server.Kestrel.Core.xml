            True as long as the blocks from this slab are to be considered returnable to the pool. In order to shrink the

            slab from the pool's _slabs collection, (2) as each block currently in use is Return()ed to the pool it will
            be allowed to be garbage collected rather than re-pooled, and (3) when all block tracking objects are garbage
            collected and the slab is no longer references the slab will be garbage collected and the memory unpinned will
            be unpinned by the slab's Dispose.
