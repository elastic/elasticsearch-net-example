            This handle pins the managed array in memory until the slab is disposed. This prevents it from being
            relocated and enables any subsections of the array to be used as native memory pointers to P/Invoked API calls.

            True as long as the blocks from this slab are to be considered returnable to the pool. In order to shrink the
            memory pool size an entire slab must be removed. That is done by (1) setting IsActive to false and removing the
            slab from the pool's _slabs collection, (2) as each block currently in use is Return()ed to the pool it will
            be allowed to be garbage collected rather than re-pooled, and (3) when all block tracking objects are garbage
            collected and the slab is no longer references the slab will be garbage collected and the memory unpinned will
            be unpinned by the slab's Dispose.

            <summary>
            Allocating 32 contiguous blocks per slab makes the slab size 128k. This is larger than the 85k size which will place the memory
            in the large object heap. This means the GC will not try to relocate this array, so the fact it remains pinned does not negatively
            affect memory management's compactification.

            a new tracking object into the pool. This will only happen if there is a bug in the server, however it is necessary to avoid
            leaving "dead zones" in the slab due to lost block tracking objects.
